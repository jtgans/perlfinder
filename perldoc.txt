       PerlFinder is a simple program that I was developing to make a MacOS X
       Finder workalike.

RREEQQUUIIRREESS
       PerlFinder currently requires the following:

           * Gtk2
           * Gtk2::GladeXML
           * XML::Simple

       These can be fetched from your local CPAN mirror.

BBUUGGSS
       * If you have a $HOME/.perlfinder remove it first before
         running. There is a bug that prevents the program from running
         completely at this point in time.
